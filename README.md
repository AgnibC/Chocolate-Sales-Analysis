I prepared a simple, yet effective sales dashboard of a global chocolate company and analysed  its performance using KPIs: 

a) How much sales are being driven by each product?(conditionally-formatted colored bars)

b) An assessment of salespersons' performance

c) How are the sales varying with time? (line chart)

d)Percentage contribution of each country to the total revenues of the firm(part to whole analysis using donut chart)



Additionally two slicers were added - a dropdown slicer listing all products and a sliding date slicer to enable the user to during a specific period for a particular product(s).


Following insights from this dashboard, can help the business to improve its sales performance:

a) The sales decline in Q3 following a peak in Q2, which is concerning because there was a steady growth in sales from Q1 to Q2. The reason behind this can be attributed to the slow sales growth in Australia and Canada during this time

b)Promotions can be increased in New Zealand and Canada to increase sales in these regions.

c)India is the only country where the sales growth have been consistent, while Australia has seen a steep decline in sales from Q1 to Q3.

d)The '85% dark bars' has seen the most amount of sales while the '70% dark bites' has seen the least. The latter can be omitted from the product portfolio to reduce costs
